# Chapter 3: Cloud Services

## Layout
Each folder contains a single word document (a tutorial for that service) along with the
original screenshots that are used in that word document.

## Order
Ideally, a student would start with GCP, then move to AWS, then
finally look at Azure. I think we should emphasize that Google Colab
is probably the ideal option for cloud development for the vast
majority of students, and this order reinforces that idea.
